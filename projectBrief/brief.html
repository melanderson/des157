  <h1>Project Brief</h1>
  <article>
    <h2>Topic summary:</h2>
    <p>I wanted to create a site where anyone can share recipes online, rate, and review them. You can share these recipes by writing them out, and it’s optional to include a video of how you cook/bake it. I wanted to create this type of website because YouTube seems to be one of the few websites for a foodie audience with more interactions from the public, and the only place where you can just post your own recipes if you want. For other recipes found online, people seem to just create their own separate websites to accomplish this. So for those who don’t want to make their own site, they can just post on this site.</p>

    <h2>Target audience description:</h2>
    <p>My target audience was originally the people of Davis, California, but I decided not to be so restrictive and allow for anyone to post, including children with the help of an adult. I think the inclusion of children would be really interesting because their diet can vary drastically when it comes from children living and growing up in different areas. Although, I want there to be an adult audience too, where people of all ages can share different techniques that’ll help people of all different levels of ability improve. So I guess my main target would be people who want to learn how to cook, or those who want to share their ability with their own tips and tricks. It is a recipe sharing site I’m aiming to create, so creating food is a central interest my audience should have.</p>

    <h2>The goals of the project:</h2>
    <p>My goal is creating a site for an audience interested in creating food and improving upon their own abilities. It will also be there for those who want to share their abilities and tricks for cooking, baking, or maintaining their cooking equipment. I want to allow others to review products put out there, taking a look at certain cookware and what the pros or cons are for them. Since I’m designing a site similar to Youtube and more social media inclined sites, I’ll try to include functions and forms that allow for other people to post their content. I want to keep a cooking site sort of look, and want to keep the main design fun for my audience.</p>

    <h2>Communication strategy:</h2>
    <p>I’m planning on this site/app(?) being a sort of social media site for, in specific, food. So I’m thinking people should be able to comment on someone’s posted content. People should also be able to post their own content, and subscribe to their favorite content creators, like how it works with Youtube. I would also like to give the creator some control of how they want the layout of their content, so allowing for them to pick a theme or create their own would be great too.</p>
  </article>

    <h2>Goals for the overall look and feel:</h2>
    <p>As I’ve stated before, I want to have my site feel like Youtube and other social media sites, while being a site just for food centered interests. I’m not sure for what type of color scheme, but I would probably choose either pastel color palette or a darker color palette of blues or purples with white to contrast. </p>
