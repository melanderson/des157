    <h3> Food Wishes </h3>
      <div>
        <img src="foodwishespage.png" alt="Food Wishes Page Link" width="350" />
        <p> Food Wishes doesn’t have great formatting for their website. It’s a page for foodie-fans that contains recipes for the audience if they want to cook the same recipe. The highlight of the page is certainly the newest recipes of the week, but the
          navigation is seriously weakened on this page. Links are under listings on the side of the webpage, but you have to scroll to get to them. The amount of different recipes is numerous too, so it would make more sense of the site made that a separate
          page under a nav tab of recipes. In fact, most of the things on the side should be in a navbar, other than the picture links. There are also two search bars, which can be confusing because one search bar is explicitly for video recipes and the
          other is an unspecified search bar. The banner is a clickable home page, which is nice, and there are other recommended recipes at the bottom of each highlighted recipe. </p>
        <p> Overall, the aesthetic of the page is clean, which is great for the audience, but the composition is a bit muddled in its format. As for interactivity, the page is a bit more formal than casual, and most of the interactivity is limited to playing
          the blog videos or clicking links. None of those links are animated, but for the audience it just makes more sense for the website to be this way since it is a food blog.

      <h3> Delicious Days </h3>
      <div>
        <img src="deliciousdayspage.png" alt="Delicious Days Page Link" width="350" />
        <p>Delicious Days takes a much more casual approach when presenting their website. It’s much more fun than Food Wishes, and a bit more organized as well. It has a navbar on the top of the page, and a searchbar that could be used for searching anything on the site. This searchbar even informs you how to use it, so there’s no confusion there. It also has a fun option to increase the size and font or decrease it. The main recipe is there, along with making the title of the recipe there obvious, and the date this entry was posted. The sidebar is clean too, with the image-links carrying their own categories and specific “news” or other categories fitting well in this bar. I honestly like this page much more than Food Wishes for how much easier it is to navigate around the site. Even the recipes are easier to find, with them organized by date and style of food, so if you wanted to see what the author has done for the time being, or just looking for a specific recipe of hers’, it’s easy to find. The aesthetic of the page is pleasing, using dashed lines in order to separate everything evenly, and the pictures are easy to see. It really accommodates itself for users who may have a hard time seeing the content they want, and those sorbet pictures are really nice.
