            <p>I always keep a hairtie or two on me, since having my hair down can be a hassle sometimes. Like when you accidently eat a mouthful of hair. I used to keep my hair up at all times, because it makes me look a bit more presentable, but I'm trying to keep my hair down again for the sake of letting my hair loose for once.</p>

            <p>I got this neat little pokemon keychain for christmas, but I started wearing keychains and the like on my pants since high school. It feels natural to keep it on me, and identifies me whenever I walk into a room since my keychain jingle is kinda distinct. Or, at least, my cats can tell from the jingle.（ΦωΦ）I've also been playing pokemon for quite a long time, so I'm pretty happy I got this little keychain, however, mine doesn't REALLY have a pikachu on it, I just drew a pikachu since it's an iconic pokemon character.

                I wear this necklace all the time, to the point where I shower with it. It's a little jade necklace I recieved from an aunt who took care of me sometimes when I was little. She's also buddhist, so on the back of the jade lotus is a swastika. And no, I'm
                not affiliated with Nazis. ಠ_ಠ It's a buddist symbol of peace and prosterity.

                These headphones are pretty spectacular. I got these when my other headset broke, and I hate earbuds since they extremely hurt to wear, at least for me. My big brother bought them for me, and neglected to tell me until he just gave them to me. He's such
                a sweetheart (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ ✧ﾟ･: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ). Now, I'm able to listen to all the best jams wherever I want. It means a lot, since I'm not always working in places where it's appropriate to blast music, or bothering my neighbors late at night.

                I love animal shaped hats. I've got a little collection going, but this beanie is one I wear the most. These hats are one of the first things people point out about me. It also covers up the fact that I have terrible bed head. Sometimes. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
