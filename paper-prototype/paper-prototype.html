    <p>Here's a quick outlook on how I wanted my website to look at. I chose a phone format because of the "design mobile first" rule. My website is basically a recipe share site that is a mix between Youtube, Pintrest, and Instagram in influence. I was
      told it looks pretty straightforward in functionality. As for where my second iteration is, both are there, I just built up on some of the functions my site would be capable of. I wasn't able to get much feedback due to the limited amount of time
      I had to work on this, but I got some of the functions I wanted in the site.
