    <h3>My Storyboards</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to draw a recipe sharing app that could be used from all over the world. My first storyboard had a bit of trouble with showing that, however it did show my intent for a recipe sharing app better.

      As for my second storyboard, the google translate better speaks to the worldwide element, however it seems to have overshadowed my original intent of displaying the recipe sharing app because of adding a "google translate" button. It was also a split
      decision thing to draw too, because my original focus was just around Davis before I figured it would be better if anyone could participate. If you hadn't figured it out yet, it's a site where you can share/post your favorite recipes and learn to
      make other recipes. Kids or adults, anyone is welcome to post, even for something as simple as a twist to your cheese sandwiches.
