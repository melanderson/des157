        <p>Here are some of the notes I jotted down when talking to the people who tested my site. </p>
        <p>Tara:The color scheme is pretty cute and simple with it’s bright pastels, but it’s still readable. The writing is HILARIOUS. Heart Symbol. Oh, just finish your other sections is fine! How’s the class going? Some people in our class are using it and they might be of help to you?
        </p>
        <p>Brian: Everything is not working… +++++++++ is the page numbers? Confusion about that. Site is straightforward. Needs to be more interactive? Use Popups loading screen? 90s feel… Basic structure. Add web structure: text is too long. Shorten it out! Change some of the colors.
        </p>
        <p>Iris: Loves the cupcake… Likes the idea of no sign in. Add more padding (Pad your text out!). Make heading in more bold font… body text too big. Change padding for importance hierarchy. Spacing between text shows no hierarchy. Fix the nav onto the screen? Maybe keep the pointillism in the banner?

      <p>I really want Firebase to work, so in my next prototype, I'll try to get the storage and database working so that people can start posting pages instead of coming to the construction page. It'll also help with creating an active search bar. I'll also see if I can have that voting page up and running too, but that relies on Firebase working out for me as well. I'm going to try to get my banner fixed so that people can interact with it. I'll also find another way to use my animated cupcake in my about page since Iris loved it so much. </p>
