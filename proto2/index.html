            <h3>A Student's Recipe for Madness</h3>
            <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Overwhelming amount of homework and projects</li>
              <li>Tightnit Deadlines</li>
              <li>Effort</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Recipe Instructions:</h5>
            <p>When starting out this recipe, you want to make sure that you have all these ingredients. First, take the overwhelming amount of homework/projects and mix them with tightnit deadlines. Pour as much effort as you can into it. The deadlines will help create anxiety and stress that students will most likely take home with them, letting it soak into the student the longer they are exposed. Eventually, it will give way to frustration when these students are unable to complete such assignments, whether it's due to the confusion the homework brings, or the stress of short deadlines. If the student manages to be able to cure all of the homework/projects, they have averted madness, for the time being. That does not leave them completly uneffected, since curing these assignments can promote sleep deprivation and if under stress long enough, it can be detrimental to the students mental and physical health. More likely than not, there will be leftover unfinished homework/projects. This can promote a student's feeling of failure, and lower self esteem. As long as you place these students in a perpetual amount of homework and deadlines, the madness will never leave them. </p>
