  <h3>Who's my Audience?</h3>
  <p>
    I decided to focus on the people of Davis as my audience, or at least the people involved in the Farmers Market that occurs on Wednesdays. The photos are of youth that can be college kids, or market producers, and families that live in Davis. (Though, really, I just took photos of me and my friends and used them.) I wanted to base my final on the seasonal produce that farmers of Davis make, and the community that buys from the Market.

  <p>
    Really, the Farmer's Market is the central focus of my Audience since the page can be used as a place to advertise their product and display what you can do with their produce.
